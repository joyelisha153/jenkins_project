Automated CI Pipeline for a Web Application using Jenkins
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a fully automated Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Jenkins for a Python Flask web application.
Whenever new code is pushed to the GitHub repository, Jenkins automatically executes a series of stages including code checkout, dependency installation, testing, build, and artifact packaging.
The goal is to ensure that the application is always in a ready-to-deploy state, improving automation, reliability, and repeatability following modern DevOps practices.

Tech Stack
Language/Framework: Python Flask
CI Tool: Jenkins

Jenkins Pipeline Overview
The pipeline has the following stages:

1. Code Checkout
Jenkins automatically pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
Ensures the pipeline always works on the latest code.
2. Install Dependencies
Jenkins sets up a Python virtual environment.
Installs required packages from requirements.txt using pip.
3. Run Tests
Executes unit tests in tests/test_app.py using Pytest.
Fails the build if any test does not pass.
4. Build
Packages the application using setup.py into distributable formats (.tar.gz and .whl).
Ensures the application is ready for deployment.
5. Package Artifact
Zips the project files into build/artifact.zip excluding virtual environment, Git metadata, and cache files.
6. Archive
Stores the final artifact in Jenkins for download or future deployment.
7. Post Actions
Cleans up the workspace.
Prints success message in the console.
Setup Instructions
1. Install Jenkins
Download Jenkins from https://www.jenkins.io/download/
Follow installation instructions for your OS.
2. Connect Jenkins with GitHub
Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.
Add your repository URL: https://github.com/JinsaJohnson/webapp-ci.git
Ensure Jenkins has access to GitHub (public repo works without credentials).
3. Create the Pipeline
Choose Pipeline in Jenkins job configuration.
Set Pipeline script from SCM if pulling Jenkinsfile from GitHub, or paste your Jenkinsfile directly.
4. Trigger Builds
Push changes to the GitHub repository main branch.
Jenkins automatically triggers the pipeline.
View the pipeline stages in Pipeline Stage View.
Expected Outputs
Unit Test Results: All tests pass (e.g., test_home).
Build Artifacts:
build/artifact.zip
dist/webapp_ci-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
dist/webapp_ci-1.0.0.tar.gz
Console Output: Shows all pipeline stages executing successfully.
Results / Screenshots
Place screenshots of your Jenkins setup in the docs/ folder:

Notes
Ensure Python 3 and pip are installed on the Jenkins server.
Virtual environment is created and removed during each build for isolation.
setup.py warning is expected due to deprecated setup.py install; still works for building artifacts.
✅ Pipeline Status: Success
All stages executed successfully, tests passed, and artifact packaged.
